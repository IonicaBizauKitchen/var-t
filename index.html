      <h3>// I love art and code.</h3>

      <p>I have spent a few years talking about and teaching programming to people as young as 8 and as old as 80. The one interest I've been able to map to all ages is art. Teaching people to code using art as a motivation has been a fun learning and teaching experience but, to be quite honest, I could learn a lot more from <em>both</em> subjects.</p>

      <p><code>var t;</code> (pronounced "vart," which rhymes with "fart" because I am 12) is a writing, art, and code project that I started to teach me and you about art, as well as to create interactive works that may motivate art lovers to program their own stuff.</p>

      <p>I hope you have as much fun reading, learning, and playing with art as much I did making it.</p>

      <p><em>xoxo j$</em></p>
