    <h3>// I love art and code.</h3>

    <p>I have spent a few years talking about and teaching programming to people as young as 8 and as old as 80. The one interest I've been able to map to all ages is art. Teaching people to code using art as a motivation has been a fun learning and teaching experience but, to be quite honest, I could learn a lot more from <em>both</em> subjects.</p>

    <p><code>var t;</code> (pronounced "vart," which rhymes with "fart" because I am 12) is a writing, art, and code project that I started to teach me and you about art, as well as to create interactive works that may motivate art lovers to program their own stuff.</p>

    <p>In October of last year I launched this project with a generative <a href="/mondrian">Piet Mondrian</a> generator. I was absolutely <em>floored</em> with the positive responses from both programmers and artists. For the first time since I was a kid, I felt validated in making art as a software engineer, and others expressed the same feeling. The following months I went for a bit more ambitious and personal project with the surrealist <a href="/magritte">Ren√© Magritte</a>, and then explored the theme of imperfection with <a href="/matisse">Henri Matisse</a>. For this first post of 2015, I wrote about an American woman named <a href="/cassatt">Mary Cassatt</a>, who broke through the male-dominated art world to become a famous Impressionist painter.</p>
    
    <p>After a few months of dealing with burnout and emotions expressed in that Cassatt post, I am back and focusing on the positive moments of the year with <a href="/seurat">Georges-Pierre Seurat</a>.</p>

    <p>I hope you have as much fun reading, learning, and playing with art as much I did making it.</p>
