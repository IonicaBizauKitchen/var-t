      <h3>// Piet Mondrian</h3>

      <p>I started with Mondrian not because he is my favorite artist (he is not), or that his work is very recognizeable (it is), but because I thought it would be a fun and easy start to this project (it was).</p>

      <p>Mondrian was a Dutch painter who changed his name in 1906 from <em>Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan</em> as sort of a personal rebranding when he left the Netherlands for Paris. A man with as bad luck as the rest of us schmucks, he went back to the Netherlands to visit and ended up stuck there because of World War I (thanks Obama). He was able to go back to Paris in 1918 and that seems to be when he changed his style from Post-Impressionist to the more abstract and grid-based work he is known for today.</p>

    </p>

      <p>His work from this time is categorized as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl">De Stijl</a> movement. Also known as "neoplasticism," the style (literally the direct translation of "De Stijl") originated in Amsterdam shortly before he went back to Paris.</p>

      <p>Mondrian found his way to Manhattan, New York, for the last years of his life. He died of pneumonia. I almost died of pneumonia in Brooklyn, so I guess he <em>was</em> much less lucky that I.</p>

      <p class="hr">* * *</p>

      <p>I am quite fond of grids and tables and also primary colors, and Mondrian's very recognizable post-WWI work always catches my eye from afar in exhibits.</p>
